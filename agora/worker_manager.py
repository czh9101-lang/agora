"""Worker profile manager — create, list, remove Hermes profiles from templates.

A "worker" is a Hermes profile with:
  - config.yaml    (with .env, both provisioned by core from the source profile)
  - SOUL.md        (role identity, rendered from template)
  - MEMORY.md      (empty initially, accumulates experience over time)
  - USER.md        (empty initially)
  - skills/        (profile-local skills directory, independent from global)
  - description    (set via `hermes profile describe`)

Workers persist across projects. Their memory, skills, and identity are
personal — they carry experience from one project to the next, just like
a real employee.

There is no separate "leader" concept at the profile level. A leader is
simply a worker created from the "leader" template. Heartbeat scheduling
lives on the *project*, not the profile — so the same leader profile can
manage multiple projects with independent heartbeat intervals and
sessions, while sharing a single MEMORY.md (experience).
